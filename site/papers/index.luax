    <h2>2015</h2>

    <p>
      This year had us develop a mathematical model to help find planes that were lost at sea. This paper won us the Outstanding Winner designation (the highest possible level of achievement). It also won us the Frank Giordano award (for excellence in the modeling process), and the MAA Award.
